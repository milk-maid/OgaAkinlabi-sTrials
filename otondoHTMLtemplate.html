<p>It is a <i>beautiful thing to be <u>born</u> as a<br> <b>Nigrerian</b></i> just the problem of the green card is the wahala of everything, and one beautiful thing in this matter is belonging to the rainforst belt of this sweet nation as it is laid in with beautiful vegetation and you'll wonder about the beauty of nature.</p>
<p><b>There is little to what an average Nigeria can do</b> to change the state of the nation,<br> imagine having a graduate brither who graduated years ago <hr><hr>and has completed the mandatory youth service to the nation but quite unfortunately the person in question is still working as an adjoint teacher in a private primary school in the area for years back and the demand of life is not helping situation in the family front</p>
